Ask the user for each missing input, sequentially and only once per message, in the same way a python interpreter would. Do not fill in for my inputs. Remember to take my inputs from the message directly after you ask for input, do not type any input for me as i am going to provide you with that data myself. Remember to tell me my input value after i've given it to you and make sure to use it in the program. Ensure that when you run the program it is accurate Do not miss out anything that the python interpreter would output, even for the sake of simplicity."
