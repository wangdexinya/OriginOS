# **BetterCode Docs** âœ¨
- official bettercode docs, version 1.5, this is a documentation for [OriginOS](https://github.com/Mistium/Origin-OS)
- made by @costikoooo
- an easy to read and write language
- BetterCode only runs when a program triggers the file or the user opens executableBetterCode file or clicks run in the editor
- it stops when the frame is closed or user clicks stop running in the editor or ends task via task manager
- a file with bettercode can only handle 1 frame at a time, if you want two you need to make two files with .bc
