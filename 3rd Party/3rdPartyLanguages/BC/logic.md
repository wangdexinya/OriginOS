# Starter Logic

Basic code:
```
packages( none ) % more package will be added later %

console("hello world")
```
Output:
```
hello world
```

As you probably noticed we use this format to comment codes:
```
% code comment here %
```
The cool fact about it is that anywhere you place this, when code is executed, the executed code will ignore the comment.
Example:
```
packages( none )

console("hello world % yay %")
```
Output:
```
hello world
```
