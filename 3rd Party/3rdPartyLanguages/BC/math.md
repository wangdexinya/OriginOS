# Math operations

```
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b
% it outputs 3 %
```

Operands:
- addition +
- substraction -
- multiplication *
- division /

You can either use two variables or two numbers.

Example:
```
a = 2
print(a + 2)
```
Output:
```
4
```

Lets automate the process:
```
def calc (operation, number1, number2):
  if operation = "+" then
    print(number1 + number2)
  else do
    print("Sorry i dont know!")
  end
end

calc ("+", 2, 2)
```
